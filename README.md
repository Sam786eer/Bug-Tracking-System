⚙️ Setup Instructions (Very Important)

1️⃣ Install Backend Dependencies

Run this in the main project folder:
npm install

2️⃣ Install Frontend Dependencies:
cd client,
npm install. 
Then return to the root:


cd ..
3️⃣ Create Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the project root (NOT inside client):
MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string,
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here


4️⃣ Start the Application (Backend + Frontend Together)
Simply run:
npm run start. 
This will:

Start backend → http://localhost:5000

Start frontend → http://localhost:3000

Both will run simultaneously using concurrently.

5️⃣ MongoDB Setup (Atlas Cloud)
Create a free cluster

Create a Database User

Copy connection string like:
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/BugView
Paste it into your .env:
MONGO_URL=YOUR_URL_HERE,
Ensure IP Allow Access = “Allow from Anywhere”
